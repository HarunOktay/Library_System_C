# Library_System_C
## Library Management System C Implementation Overview
This is a library management system implemented in C programming language. It allows users to manage students, authors, books, and book loans in a library setting. 
This project was created for the 2nd grade 1st semester structural programming course.

## Features

    - Choose options to manage students, authors, books, or book loans.
    - Follow on-screen instructions to perform desired actions.

## File Structure
- **library_management.c**: Main source code file containing the implementation of the library management system.
- **README.md**: This file, providing information about the program.
